# LCD_Launchpad library for MSP432P4111

This is a forked version of the [MSP430](https://github.com/energia/msp430-lg-core/tree/master/libraries/LCD_Launchpad) LCD library for the MSP432P4111. This library is based much more closely on the original TI example code for interfacing with the FH-1138P. Currently only `showText()` and `blinkText()` are supported.
